# TO-DO Web Application

![banner](https://github.com/DevTony101/js-todo-app-indexed_db/blob/master/banner.png)

This a sample project, product of a series of tutorials made by myself on **DEV**. The aim is to teach/learn the basics of the IndexedDB API, specifically:

- Learn about the concepts of transactions, requests, object stores
- Learn how to perform CRUD operations in the IndexedDB instance
